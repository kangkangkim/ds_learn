Use the data loans_income.csv to do listed practice:

Read the data in pandas, 
1. Draw a sample with 1000 observations. Plot the sample's data distribution
2. Implemented bootstrap to take 10, 50 , 100, 1000 times resampling to repeatedly draw an income sample with 10 incomes. Plot the sample mean distribution for each resampling 
3. Implemented bootstrap to take 10, 50 , 100, 1000 times resampling to repeatedly draw an income sample with 100 incomes. Plot the sample mean distribution for each resampling 
4. Overlapping distribution plots in 2 and 3 when resampling time is the same.
